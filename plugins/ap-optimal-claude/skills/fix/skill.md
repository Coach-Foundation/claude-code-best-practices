# Fix Workflow

Use when the user says "fix", "/fix", reports a bug, or pastes an error/traceback.

## Step 1: Create `tasks/fix-[bug-slug].md`

```markdown
# Fix: [Bug Description]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Investigating

## Bug Report
[Exact error, symptoms, or failing behavior]

## Reproduction Steps
1.
2.

## Suspected Root Cause
[Initial hypothesis - update as you investigate]

## Fix Approach
[What will be changed and why]

## Verification
- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces
- [ ] Related tests pass
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Root Cause (post-fix)
[Fill in after fix confirmed]
```

## Step 2: Investigate

Invoke `superpowers:systematic-debugging` to work through the root cause systematically.

## Step 3: Update the artifact

After the fix is confirmed working:
- Set Status: Resolved
- Fill in Root Cause section
- Check off all Verification items
