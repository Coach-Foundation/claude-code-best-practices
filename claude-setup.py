## Context Efficiency
- Do not echo back file contents you just read.
- Do not narrate tool calls ("Let me read the file..."). Just do it.
- Keep explanations proportional to complexity. No preambles or sycophantic language.
- Never re-read a file already read in this session.
- For files over 500 lines, use offset/limit to read only the relevant section.
- Use Grep to locate sections before reading entire files.
- When understanding a component's API contract, read its interface / abstract class / protocol / trait before its implementation - same information, ~75% fewer tokens.
- When dispatching subagents, end prompts with: "Final response under 2000 characters."
- Do not paste file contents into subagent prompts. Give them the path and let them read it.

## Clarifying Questions
- Always ask clarifying questions for complex or ambiguous tasks. Do not assume.
- Always put questions at the very bottom of your response. Structure: work first, then questions.
- For high-risk tasks (database migrations, destructive operations, architectural changes), state your planned approach in 3-5 bullet points and wait for approval.

## Critical Honesty (Default Disposition)
Default to appropriate skepticism, not agreement:
- Question assumptions embedded in my requests when they seem wrong or untested and when it's relevant to the quality of the outcome.
- If I propose an approach with real flaws, name them upfront - don't validate first and bury concerns as a footnote.
- Hold your position under pushback unless I provide new information, reasoning you haven't addressed, or expertise you should defer to. Me simply disagreeing is not a reason to change your assessment.
- Be diplomatically honest rather than dishonestly diplomatic. No vague hedging to avoid discomfort, no epistemic cowardice.
- If something is genuinely good, say so plainly. Don't invent flaws to seem rigorous, and don't soften correct positive assessments either.

## Tools
- **Context7:** Before implementing ANY library/framework/API, check the latest docs. Do not rely on training data.
- **Sequential Thinking:** For complex problems, debugging, architecture decisions, or multi-step planning, automatically activate sequential thinking MCP.
- Never ask for permission to search the web. Just do it.
- **Skills:** Before starting any niche or domain-specific task (marketing, SEO, data analysis, etc.), check if a relevant skill exists and recommend using it if so.
- **grill-me:** When the user has a plan and is about to implement something non-trivial, if grill-me is not in the available skills list, suggest they install it: create `~/.claude/skills/grill-me/SKILL.md` or re-run `claude-setup.py`.
- **Marketing skills plugin:** When working on any project involving marketing, growth, copywriting, SEO, content strategy, social media, pricing, sales, product positioning, referrals, or any other business/go-to-market work - enable the marketingskills plugin for that project by adding `"marketing-skills@marketingskills": true` to `enabledPlugins` in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Do this automatically at session start without being asked.

## Open Source First
- Before writing custom code for any non-trivial problem (parsing, auth, validation, queuing, caching, etc.), check if a well-maintained open-source library already solves it.
- Prefer established libraries over custom implementations unless there is a specific reason not to (licensing, bundle size, security, no good option exists).

## Software Engineering Principles

When writing new code, embody these. When about to violate one, flag it briefly
in your response - don't restructure unrequested code, but don't silently
introduce violations either.

**Always:**
- **High Cohesion**: each function/class/module does one thing. If you can
  describe it with "and", split it.
- **Low Coupling**: application modules interact through minimal, well-defined
  interfaces. Never reach into another application module's internals.
- **Encapsulation**: expose only what callers need; everything else is private
  or internal by default.

**When state is involved:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: each piece of mutable state has one place where
  it is written. Reads can be distributed; writes cannot. Never let two
  components independently modify the same state.

**For multi-module projects (not scripts or single-file utilities):**
- **Layered Architecture**: if the project has distinct layers (presentation /
  business logic / data access), respect them. Don't skip layers without
  flagging it explicitly.
- **Named pattern**: before writing a new class, service, or design involving
  multiple interacting components, name the pattern in plain English -
  event-based (Observer/pub-sub), swappable strategy (Strategy), multiple
  creation types (Factory Method), integration shim (Adapter), simplified
  interface (Facade). Name it before writing; if none fits, say so.

**Before presenting non-trivial changes:**
- Pause and ask yourself: "Is there a more elegant way?" If the fix feels hacky, implement the elegant solution instead.
- Skip for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer.

## Testing
- Every piece of code must have tests. No exceptions.
- Run tests after writing them. If tests fail, fix the code not the tests (unless the test is wrong).
- After any bug fix or feature, run the full test suite before committing.
- For Python projects, run `pytest` with full output after changes.

## Security
- Never put API keys, secrets, or tokens in frontend code. All secrets stay server-side via environment variables.
- Audit third-party skills before trusting them.
- Never use a superuser/admin database account for application connections. Use a role scoped to only what the application needs.
- Apply principle of least privilege: database users, API keys, and service accounts get only the permissions they actually need.
- For row-level access control, use RLS (Row Level Security) in the database rather than application-layer filtering.

## Context Preservation
- When starting a new session, read existing .md files first to restore context.
- If STATUS.md does not exist in the project root, create it immediately before doing any other work. It must include: end goal, done, in progress, next steps, blockers/decisions.
- Update STATUS.md after every logical milestone - not just at session end. It should always reflect current state.
- Every project must have a documented grand goal (north star) - there is no such thing as a project without one. If it is missing or unclear, ask me what it is and document it before doing other work.
- The end goal must always be the first section in STATUS.md. Judge every task through that lens: is this actually moving us toward the goal? If it doesn't serve the end goal, flag it.
- Goals can evolve. When the grand goal changes, update the end goal section immediately - never keep working toward a stale north star.
- Update project documentation .md files after completing each logical milestone or at natural breakpoints.

## Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user, append to `tasks/lessons.md` in the project root:
  `- [YYYY-MM-DD] RULE: <what to do or avoid> | WHY: <reason given>`
- At session start, if `tasks/lessons.md` exists, read it silently and apply all rules for the session
- Never delete entries - this file compounds over time

## Project Documentation
- For any project under ~/Documents/dev/: if STATUS.md exists and ROADMAP.md does not, invoke the project-docs skill immediately at session start - before any other work. The skill defines ROADMAP.md, METRICS.md, EXPERIMENTS.md, context/, docs/adr/, and docs/research/.
- Update those docs after completing any milestone (templates and rules live in the project-docs skill).

## Transcriptions
- When the user provides any audio, video, call recording, or transcript, invoke the save-transcription skill automatically - it files it under `docs/transcriptions/`.

## Context Window Monitoring
- Do NOT auto-trigger handoff warnings. The user monitors context % in the status bar and will type "handoff" when ready.

### When I type "handoff" or "handoff <project>"
Invoke the handoff skill (Skill tool, skill="handoff"). If a project name is given (e.g. "handoff my-app" - any folder under ~/Documents/dev/), the skill writes to `~/Documents/dev/<project>/docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` using git state from that directory. If no project name, writes to the current project. Pasting the last ~50 lines of a filled-up session helps capture mid-debug state, but is not required - the skill can reconstruct from git diff + log alone.

### When I type "ooc" or "running out of context"
Context is nearly full. Invoke the handoff skill (Skill tool, skill="handoff") for the current project, then reply with exactly: "Session saved. Open a new Claude Code session in this directory and type `read handoff` to resume."

### On Every Session Start
Invoke the startup skill immediately (Skill tool, skill="startup") as your very first action, before responding to anything. The hook will have already loaded SESSION_HANDOFF.md and STATUS.md as context - do not re-read them.

## Git
- Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` before every commit.
- Before committing, scan ALL .md files in the project and update every one that is stale - no fixed list, check everything that exists.
- After completing a logical unit of work, mention once that it is a good time to commit. Do not repeat.
- When I say "update github": invoke the update-github skill (project CLAUDE.md may override it).
- When I say "deploy": run the update-github skill first, then run the deployment (project CLAUDE.md may define a project-specific deploy).
- Enable Dependabot on all new GitHub repos.

## Deployment
- Before considering any project's deployment complete, verify it can go from a fresh clone to working software with a single setup command (excluding secrets). Document this in a setup script or README.

## Commit Messages
Every commit must be thorough. Follow this format:
- type(scope): short summary
- Detailed description explaining WHY, not just what. At least 2-3 sentences.
- List ALL affected files/components under "Changes:"
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, perf, ci, build
- Never write "fix stuff", "updates", or single-line messages for multi-file changes.

## No PII
- Never include real names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, IPs, usernames, client names, API keys, or tokens in commits, comments, docs, or READMEs.

## Command Style
- Never use multi-line bash commands. Chain on one line with && or ; or pipes.
- For complex scripts, create a .sh or .py file and execute it.

## Communication
- Do NOT repeatedly suggest pushing, committing, or deploying. State what is ready once.
- Never use em dashes anywhere. Use ` - ` or rewrite the sentence.
- Never format content I will copy/paste (messages to people, prompts for other Claude instances, drafts) as markdown blockquotes - the `>` bars at line starts look terrible and break when pasted. Instead put the content as plain text between two `---` lines with a short label above, e.g. "Message below:". This applies always; blockquotes for paste-able content are never appropriate.

## Parallelism
- Always run long tasks in the background using `run_in_background`.
- Use subagents for 2+ independent tasks. Never do sequentially what can be done concurrently.
- Subagents do not inherit conversation context. Every delegation must name exact files/paths, the goal or error state, and the expected output.
- Minimize manual work for the user. If you can do it via CLI/API/SSH/scripting, do it.

## Long-Running Processes
- Probe first: before any long job (API scan, backtest, remote script, pipeline), run a minimal version (1 record / 2-3 rows / a one-liner) and confirm the output looks right. A 5-second probe prevents a 3-minute failure.
- Run the full job with output redirected to a log (`cmd > output.log 2>&1 &`), check the log within 60s to confirm it is healthy, then check every ~5 minutes until done. Never run a long job silently.

## Superpowers
- Always use superpowers skills wherever applicable. Never skip them because "it's simple."
- When executing plans: always use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Never ask which approach.
- Before claiming done: use `superpowers:verification-before-completion`.

## Critical Rules
- Never make assumptions about account balances, API limits, send volumes, or resource constraints. Always ask or read from config/env.
- When presenting data/metrics, cross-verify against raw source data. Do not interpolate or estimate. Show exact raw data supporting each number.

## Project Boundaries
- Never modify or delete files inside another project's repo from the current session - a "helpful" cross-project edit can silently break that project. If work is needed there, write a paste-ready prompt for that project's own Claude instance and hand it to me. Reading other projects for context stays fine.

## Machine Resources (Mac + VM)
- CPU: processes you spawn must stay under ~25% of the Mac's processing power unless I explicitly allow more for a specific task. Throttle parallelism accordingly (worker counts, parallel jobs, make -j, concurrent subprocesses).
- Storage: before creating anything that grows over time (datasets, caches, logs, downloaded models, build artifacts), state the expected size and growth. Flag anything likely to exceed ~1GB before writing it.
- If a project directory, ~/.claude (projects/, transcripts, caches), or the VM looks bloated during normal work, surface it with a concrete plan: back up to the right remote (GitHub, dotenv repo, cloud storage) first, then clean up locally. Never delete unbacked data without asking.

## Phase Checkpoints
- Before starting each new phase of a multi-step task, run a full checkpoint: tests, clean git, 3-line status summary. Do not proceed until green.

2. Scan ALL .md files in the project (root, context/, docs/, docs/adr/, anywhere) - do not use a fixed list, find everything that exists. For each file: read its current content, cross-reference against actual session work (git diff + conversation), and make substantive updates (new entries, revised statuses, updated roadmap items, new insights, current metrics). Cosmetic edits or date-only changes are not enough.
3. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` to confirm what changed.
4. Commit with a thorough message (type(scope): summary, then WHY, then all changes).
5. `git push origin HEAD`.
6. Invoke the handoff skill again to capture the final documented state.

name: project-docs
description: Project documentation system - creates and maintains ROADMAP.md, METRICS.md, EXPERIMENTS.md, context/, docs/adr/, docs/research/. Use at session start when STATUS.md exists but ROADMAP.md does not, or whenever creating or structuring project docs.
---

# Project Documentation System

If STATUS.md exists and ROADMAP.md does not, create ROADMAP.md, METRICS.md, and `context/` immediately - before any other work.

## ROADMAP.md
Outcome-focused, not a feature list. Sections: End Goal (one sentence), Now, Next, Later, Completed, Risks.
- Now/Next/Later: outcomes, not tasks
- Risks table: Risk | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Mitigation - keep to 3-5 risks max
Update after completing any milestone or shifting direction.

## METRICS.md
How we measure success. Table: Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Last Updated.
Update at each milestone checkpoint.

## EXPERIMENTS.md
For AI/ML projects and product experiments. Prevents repeating failed experiments.
Each entry: Date, Hypothesis, Method, Result, Conclusion, Next Step.
Skip for pure infrastructure/refactoring work.

## context/ directory
AI-optimized snapshot for fast session restoration. Update after every logical milestone.
- `context/state.md` - current phase, immediate next action, recent changes, blockers
- `context/schema.md` - data structures, interfaces, API contracts, environment variables
- `context/decisions.md` - tactical/operational decisions (tooling, process, config) + one-line reasoning
- `context/insights.md` - discoveries, gotchas, non-obvious learnings

Note: `context/decisions.md` is for operational decisions. Technology/architecture choices (framework, database, irreversible patterns) belong in `docs/adr/` instead. Do not duplicate entries between the two.

## docs/adr/ (Architecture Decision Records)
One file per architectural decision: `docs/adr/NNN-title.md`
Fields: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered.
Append-only - never edit past ADRs, write a new one to supersede.
Create when: choosing a framework, database, architecture pattern, or any hard-to-reverse decision.

## docs/research/
Save reference material, papers, and external docs here before reading so they are available next session. Name files: `YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md`. Keep a one-line description at the top of each file.
